        Python has a lot of applications. It's used for developing web applications, data science, rapid application development, and so on.
        Python allows you to write programs in fewer lines of code than most of the programming languages.
        The popularity of Python is growing rapidly. Now it's one of the most popular programming languages.
        Python is a powerful general-purpose programming language. It is used to develop web applications, data science, creating software prototypes and so on. Fortunately for beginners, Python has simple easy-to-use syntax. 
        The mission of the Python Software Foundation is to promote, protect, and advance the Python programming language, 
        and to support and facilitate the growth of a diverse and international community of Python programmers.
        Python can be used to develop different applications like web applications, graphic user interface based applications, software development application, scientific and numeric applications, network programming, Games and 3D applications and other business applications.

        A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. 
        A database is usually controlled by a database management system (DBMS). Together, the data and the DBMS, along with the
         applications that are associated with them, are referred to as a database system,   often shortened to just database.
        Data within the most common types of databases in operation today is typically modeled in rows and columns in a series of tables 
        to make processing and data querying efficient. The data can then be easily accessed, managed, modified, updated, controlled, and organized. 
        Most databases use structured query language (SQL) for writing and querying data.
